        <h3>1. Digital Product Nature</h3>
        <p>
          All products offered on Become Fit are digitally delivered fitness guides.
          Once payment is completed, users receive instant access to the digital content.
        </p>

        <h3>2. No Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Due to the nature of digital products and immediate access after payment,
          all sales are final. We do not offer refunds, cancellations, or exchanges
          once the purchase has been successfully completed.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Duplicate or Failed Payments</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of a duplicate payment or failed transaction where the amount
          is deducted but access is not provided, users may contact us for resolution.
          Such cases will be reviewed individually.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Technical Issues</h3>
        <p>
          If you experience technical issues accessing your purchased content,
          please contact us immediately. We will ensure access is restored but
          this does not qualify for a refund.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Incorrect Purchase</h3>
        <p>
          Users are responsible for reviewing product details before completing
          a purchase. Incorrect purchases or change of mind do not qualify for refunds.
